abstract = {The ground is a virtually unlimited, ubiquitously accessible heat source and sink for heat pumps. Deep boreholes may be used as heat exchangers in the ground. We present an extensive analysis of such a heat extraction (or injection) borehole. The effects of stratification of the ground, climatic variations, geothermal gradient, and groundwater filtration are dealt with. A basic tool for the analysis is the solution for a heat-extraction step. The thermal disturbance at and near the ground surface is shown to be negligible. Thermal recharge in order to improve the heat-extraction capacity a few months later is shown to be futile. The thermal processes in the borehole are, in good approximation, represented by a single borehole resistance. Formulae that relate the heat-extraction rate to the required extraction temperatures are given. They are based on superpositions of steady-state, periodic, and extraction-step solutions. A response-test method is proposed for the determination of three important parameters: average thermal conductivity in the ground, borehole thermal resistance, and average undisturbed ground temperature.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a new methodology for the generation of thermal response factors of geothermal bore fields using the concept of g-functions introduced by Eskilson. Boreholes are divided into segments to consider the variation of the heat extraction rates along the length of the boreholes and the analytical finite line source (FLS) solution is used to calculate the temperature variations at the wall of each borehole segment along the axial direction. The proposed methodology accounts for the time variation of the heat extraction rates among boreholes and along the length of individual boreholes to obtain a uniform borehole wall temperature equal for all boreholes in accordance with the original boundary conditions proposed by Eskilson. In addition, the methodology is generalized to account for boreholes of different lengths and buried depths. g-Functions calculated with the proposed methodology are compared to the numerical technique used by Eskilson to derive the g-functions for fields of 1 to 12×12 boreholes. The difference between the two models is within 5% for all studied bore fields, except for fields of boreholes located on a single row. The variation of the heat extraction rates of individual boreholes along their length as well as in time also showed good agreement with the numerical model. It is shown that using 12 borehole segments is adequate to calculate the g-functions in most practical cases. For instance, the error on the g-function of a 10×10 bore field calculated using 12 borehole segments is 2.2% after 20years and 4.7% at steady-state.},

abstract = {Numerical methods are proposed for the efficient evaluation of the g-functions of geothermal bore fields using the finite line source solution. The presented methods reduce the calculation time for the calculation of g-functions by reducing the number of numerical evaluations of the analytical finite line source solution. A similarity identification method is presented to identify pairs of boreholes for which the finite line source solution takes the same value. A load history reconstruction method is presented to evaluate the g-function at non-uniform time-steps. Using the proposed numerical methods, the calculation time for the g-function of a rectangular field of 12 × 12 boreholes is reduced by a factor 308. The numerical methods allow the evaluation of g-functions of bore fields with large amounts of boreholes in irregular configurations. The g-function of a field of 512 randomly positioned boreholes is calculated in 27 minutes.},
